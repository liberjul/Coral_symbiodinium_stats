# Coral_symbiodinium_stats


# Project Background/Idea 

Coral Symbiodinium Communities - Coral associated symbiodinium has been shown to vary between different coral species, different thermal regimes, and different geographic locations. Additionally, some symbiodinium clades such as clade D1 have been shown to increase thermal tolerance of the corals. This idea is to explore the proportion of D1 symbionts in different species of coral at different depths to see how the D1  symbiont proportion changes with different depths. The depth levels will be modelled as a categorical variable with three levels: shallow reef flat (0-2m), mid reef (2-5m), and deep reef (below 5m). Since continuous proportions are being modelled, this will be the beta distribution.
